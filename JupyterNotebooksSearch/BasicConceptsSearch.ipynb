This notebook uses implementations from [search.py](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/search.py) module. Let's start by importing everything from the search module.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is also a bigger notebook, *search.ipynb*, in the same root directory, which contains more examples from the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*. \n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce some important concepts in search algorithms, namely:\n",
    "* Problem\n",
    "* Node\n",
    "* Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "They serve as a foundation of the search algorithms we will write in the following notebooks. You will also benefit from the way of thinking: how to decompose a problem, how to model it and how to solve it by searching.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, despite of being a little tedious to read this notebook, we highly suggest you first get an idea of those concepts before moving on to other notebooks we provide. Then, if anything is not clear, you can always come back and review some of the ideas here."
